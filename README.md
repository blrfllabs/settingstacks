# Setting Stacks

**NOTE:  This software is beta and may be buggy or not fully functional.**

Setting Stacks is a Tasker project which partially emulates the behavior of [Setting Profiles](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.probeez.profiles&hl=en), which was first released at about the same time Tasker was in its initial beta (ca. spring 2010).  Setting Profiles continues to be a good application, but a lack of maintenance since late 2012 has made it less than compatible with some newer versions of Android and some devices.

See the [Setting Stacks Wiki](https://github.com/blrfllabs/settingstacks/wiki) for detailed information.
