  See https://github.com/blrfllabs/settingstacks for documentation and
  other details.


  NOTE: This file is generated from Setting_Stacks.prj.xml-exported,
  which is the original project exported from Tasker.  While it is not
  usual practice to store a generated file in a VCS, this is done to
  make it easy for end users to download a copy.  See the development
  notes in the Setting Stacks wiki on GitHub for more information.
